# MOSFET Dimension Predictor using Genetic Algorithms

Designing transistors requires precision, foresight, and efficient computational methods. This project harnesses the power of genetic algorithms to predict the optimal sizes and capacities for designing MOSFET transistors, ensuring they meet the desired performance specifications.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

In the quest to optimize MOSFET designs, traditional methodologies often fall short or require extensive time and effort. During my second year at university, under the close guidance of a professor, two genetic algorithms were developed to bridge this gap. These algorithms were built upon real data gathered from our laboratory experiments, ensuring reliable and accurate predictions.
